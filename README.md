# OpenAPI Changes

## The world's **_sexiest_** OpenAPI diff tool.

We will get to the sexy part in a moment, but in a nutshell `openapi-changes` allows you 
to see and explore what has changed with your OpenAPI Specification, between a single change, 
or for all time! 

Explore OpenAPI change history using a terminal or a browser, you decide which experience suits you. Perfect for
individual use, or in a CI/CD pipeline for automation.

> This is an early tool and is active, daily development

## How is it the 'sexiest'?
