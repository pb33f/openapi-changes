# Partial Breaking Rules Configuration
# =====================================
# You don't need to specify every rule - just the ones you want to override.
# All unspecified rules will use the default values from libopenapi.
#
# This is useful when you only need to tweak a few specific behaviors
# without having to maintain a complete configuration file.
#
# Example: Your team has decided that removing enum values is acceptable
# because you use a deprecation process that gives clients time to migrate.

schema:
  enum:
    removed: false    # Allow enum value removal without flagging as breaking

# That's it! All other rules (hundreds of them) use sensible defaults.
# See valid-config.yaml for a more comprehensive example.
